<h2 class="header">BookShelves for book exchanges is Good for the Environment</h2>
<p class="content">One neat aspect of participating in a book exchange is the benefit to the environment.
 According to Greenpeace, one Canadian Spruce tree can produce only 24 books.
  This means with only a couple of dozen exchanges you will have saved a tree. 
  Participating in a book exchange also saves on ink and leaves a smaller environmental footprint than printing a book.</p>
